# The from_entity mapping fills slots based on extracted entities. 
# It will look for an entity called entity_name to fill a slot slot_name. 
# If intent_name is None, the slot will be filled regardless of intent name. 
# Otherwise, the slot will only be filled if the user's intent is intent_name.
